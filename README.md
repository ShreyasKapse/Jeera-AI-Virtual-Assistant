# Jeera AI Virtual Assistant

![Jeera Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150) <!-- Add a logo if available -->

**Jeera** is a Python-based virtual assistant designed to help users perform various tasks using voice commands. It is a lightweight, modular, and customizable assistant that can be used for personal or educational purposes. Jeera is built using Python libraries such as `pyttsx3`, `speech_recognition`, `pywhatkit`, and more, making it easy to extend and modify.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Jeera can understand and execute voice commands.
- **Task Automation**: Perform tasks like opening websites, playing YouTube videos, searching Wikipedia, and more.
- **Multitasking**: Handle multiple commands sequentially without needing to restart.
- **Offline Functionality**: Works offline for basic tasks like text-to-speech and simple commands.
- **Customizable**: Easily add new features or modify existing ones using Python.
